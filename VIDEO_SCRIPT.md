# Video Walkthrough Script

## Introduction (30 seconds)

"Hello! Today I'm excited to show you the Red Packet dApp - a full-featured decentralized application showcasing the universal FHEVM SDK. This project demonstrates how to build privacy-preserving dApps with a clean, modular architecture."

[Show the landing page with the beautiful gradient UI]

## Project Overview (1 minute)

"This submission includes three main components:

1. A universal FHEVM SDK with modular architecture - featuring core utilities, React hooks, and storage adapters
2. A production-ready smart contract for red packets with password protection and refund functionality
3. A beautiful Next.js dApp with an intuitive user interface

The entire project follows best practices for reusability, documentation, and developer experience."

## SDK Architecture (1.5 minutes)

"The FHEVM SDK is designed to be framework-agnostic with a wagmi-like modular API. Let me show you the structure:

- The core module provides framework-independent utilities for FHE operations
- The React module offers hooks like useFhevm, useFHEEncryption, and useFHEDecrypt
- The storage module handles key management with flexible adapters

[Show the SDK file structure]

Here's how easy it is to use - less than 10 lines of code to get started:

```tsx
import { useFhevm, useFHEEncryption } from '@fhevm-sdk/react';

const { instance } = useFhevm({ provider, chainId });
const { encryptWith } = useFHEEncryption({ 
  instance, 
  ethersSigner, 
  contractAddress 
});
```

[Show code example]

The SDK exports are clean and modular - you can import from @fhevm-sdk/core, @fhevm-sdk/react, or @fhevm-sdk/storage depending on your needs."

## Smart Contract (1 minute)

"The RedPacket smart contract implements a complete red packet system with:
- Create packets with custom amounts, packet counts, and durations
- Password protection for private packets
- Random distribution of funds
- Refund system for expired packets
- Full security with ReentrancyGuard and proper checks

[Show the contract code briefly]

The contract has been thoroughly tested with comprehensive test cases covering all scenarios."

## dApp Demonstration (2 minutes)

"Now let's see the dApp in action. The UI is modern and beautiful with gradient designs and smooth animations.

[Open the dApp in browser]

First, I'll connect my wallet to Sepolia testnet."

[Connect wallet]

"The interface has three main sections:

1. Create Red Packet - where you can create new red packets
2. Claim Red Packet - to claim packets by ID
3. My Red Packets - a dashboard of your created packets

Let me create a red packet:
- I'll set 0.01 ETH as the total amount
- Create 5 packets for random distribution
- Add a password for privacy
- Set it to expire in 24 hours

[Fill out the form and create]

Great! The transaction is confirmed and we have a packet ID. Now let's claim a red packet.

[Switch to Claim tab]

I'll enter the packet ID and search for it. Here we can see all the packet information:
- Status, type, amounts
- Creation and expiration times
- How many packets have been claimed

Now I'll enter the password and claim."

[Claim the packet]

"Excellent! We successfully claimed a random amount from the red packet.

Finally, let's check the My Red Packets section to see our created packets with all the statistics."

[Show My Red Packets tab]

## Documentation (30 seconds)

"The project includes comprehensive documentation:
- A detailed SDK README with API reference
- Setup guide for quick start
- Deployment guide for production
- Example usage files for different frameworks
- This video script for the walkthrough

[Show documentation files]

Everything is designed to make onboarding as smooth as possible for developers."

## Judging Criteria Alignment (1 minute)

"Let me highlight how this project meets the judging criteria:

**Usability**: Setup requires less than 10 lines - just clone, install, and run. The SDK has an intuitive API similar to wagmi.

**Completeness**: Full FHEVM flow with initialization, encrypted inputs, decryption with EIP-712 signing, and contract interactions.

**Reusability**: Modular architecture with separate core, React, and storage modules. The core is framework-agnostic and can be used in Vue, Node.js, or any JavaScript environment.

**Documentation**: Comprehensive docs with setup guide, API reference, examples for multiple frameworks, and clear code comments.

**Creativity**: Unique red packet use case with a beautiful, engaging UI. The random distribution and password protection make it fun and practical."

## Quick Start Demo (30 seconds)

"To prove how easy it is to get started, let me show you the installation:

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd fhevm-sdk
pnpm install
cd packages/nextjs
pnpm dev
```

[Type commands quickly]

And that's it! The app is running. Total time: less than 2 minutes from clone to running app."

## Conclusion (30 seconds)

"In summary, this project delivers:
- A production-ready universal FHEVM SDK
- A secure and tested smart contract
- A beautiful and functional dApp
- Comprehensive documentation
- Easy setup and great developer experience

All the code is open source, well-documented, and ready to use. Thank you for watching, and I hope you find this SDK useful for building privacy-preserving dApps!"

## Recording Tips

1. **Screen Setup**: 
   - 1920x1080 resolution
   - Clean desktop
   - Close unnecessary applications
   - Use a code theme with good contrast

2. **Recording Tools**:
   - OBS Studio or Loom
   - 30 FPS minimum
   - 1080p resolution
   - Clear audio with noise cancellation

3. **Pacing**:
   - Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
   - Pause between sections
   - Show code for 3-5 seconds before moving on
   - Keep total length around 8-10 minutes

4. **Visuals**:
   - Highlight important code sections
   - Use zoom for small text
   - Show the full workflow
   - Demonstrate actual transactions

5. **Post-Production**:
   - Add chapter markers
   - Include captions
   - Add transition effects
   - Background music (optional, keep it subtle)
